## **Module 1: Ask Effective Questions**

### **Importance of Questions in Data Analysis**

* Data analysts **ask questions** to:
  * Understand  **business problems** .
  * Find  **data-driven solutions** .
  * Guide the  **analysis process** .

### **Six Phases of Data Analysis**

1. **Ask** – Define the problem and expectations.
2. **Prepare** – Gather and organize relevant data.
3. **Process** – Clean and check data for accuracy.
4. **Analyze** – Perform calculations and extract insights.
5. **Share** – Present findings using dashboards and reports.
6. **Act** – Implement decisions based on insights.

### **SMART Questions**

* **S**pecific – Focused on a problem (e.g.,  *What features do people look for in a car?* ).
* **M**easurable – Can be quantified (e.g.,  *How many customers prefer electric cars?* ).
* **A**ctionable – Helps in decision-making (e.g.,  *Should we launch a new product variant?* ).
* **R**elevant – Tied to business goals.
* **T**ime-bound – Covers a specific period (e.g.,  *Which car features were popular in the last three years?* ).

#### **Examples of SMART Questions**

* *What are the top five features people want in a new car?*
* *On a scale of 1-10, how important is fuel efficiency?*
* *How does four-wheel drive impact car purchasing decisions?*

### **Things to Avoid When Asking Questions**

1. **Leading Questions** – Suggest a specific answer.
   * ❌ *This product is too expensive, isn’t it?*
   * ✅ *What is your opinion of this product?*
2. **Closed-Ended Questions** – Limit responses.
   * ❌ *Were you satisfied with customer service?* ( *Yes/No answer* )
   * ✅ *What aspects of customer service could be improved?*
3. **Vague Questions** – Lack context.
   * ❌ *Does the tool work for you?*
   * ✅ *How does the new tool compare to the previous one in terms of speed and efficiency?*

## **Module 2: Make Data-Driven Decisions**

### **Types of Data-Driven Decision Making**

#### **1. Data-Driven Decisions**

* **Facts and figures** guide business choices.
* Example: **A/B testing** on a website to determine which layout increases sales.

#### **2. Data-Inspired Decisions**

* Uses **both data and intuition** to make better decisions.
* Example: Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) + Employee feedback = Strategy to improve customer experience.

### **Case Studies: Success and Failure**

#### **Success - PepsiCo**

* PepsiCo used **centralized cloud data** and external sources to:
  * Understand consumer needs.
  * Improve  **marketing and product strategies** .

#### **Failure - Coca-Cola (New Coke)**

* **200,000 taste tests** showed people preferred "New Coke".
* **Mistake** : Ignored emotional attachment to the original Coke.
* **Result** : Massive backlash, loss of millions.

#### **Failure - NASA Mars Orbiter**

* **Metric vs. Imperial units mix-up** caused a  **$125 million loss** .
* **Lesson** : Ensure  **consistent data communication** .

## **Module 3: Spreadsheet Magic**

### **Types of Data**

1. **Quantitative Data** – Numbers, measurable facts.
   * *Example: Monthly sales, attendance figures.*
2. **Qualitative Data** – Descriptive, non-numerical insights.
   * *Example: Customer feedback, interviews.*

### **Data Collection Methods**

* **Quantitative** : Surveys, structured interviews.
* **Qualitative** : Focus groups, open-ended questions.

### **Using Spreadsheets for Data Analysis**

* **Functions and Formulas** :
* `SUM()` – Adds values.
* `AVERAGE()` – Finds the mean.
* `COUNTIF(range, criteria)` – Counts cells matching criteria.
* **Data Cleaning Techniques** :
* Remove  **duplicates** .
* Check for  **missing values** .
* Format data properly.
* **Error Handling in Spreadsheets** :
* `#DIV/0!` – Division by zero.
* `#NAME?` – Incorrect function name.
* `#N/A` – Data not found.

### **Big Data Characteristics (The 4 Vs)**

1. **Volume** – Large amounts of data.
2. **Variety** – Different types (text, images, videos).
3. **Velocity** – Speed of processing.
4. **Veracity** – Reliability and quality of data.
